I clicked the github.com/trending link and then I clicked the microsoft/terminal tab.

One of the problems I found in this is: Improve 'startingDirectory' functionality #604. 
Looking at this problem it looks like multiple people look at the problem and input what they 
believe is the best solution to solve that matter. 
To keep the community all organized they have multiple numbers next to everything they do 
Examples: 
- Fix downlevel support for traditional console #562
- static analyis fixes #553
The repository/project is organized by having requirements. In this one you need
- At least 2 approving reviews who have write access
- 4 checks that have passed 
- And merging performed by 2 approving reviews.
